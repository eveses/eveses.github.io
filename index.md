> Hello. This blog records my preparation for **OSCP** (Offensive Security) and **AWS** (Cloud Architecture) certifications.

Here you will find my study notes and write-ups across two main domains:

* **Offensive (Red):** [Hack The Box]({{ '/hackthebox/' | relative_url }}) and [TryHackMe]({{ '/tryhackme/' | relative_url }}) write-ups, plus a practical [cheatsheet]({{ '/cheatsheet/' | relative_url }}).
* **Cloud (Blue):** [AWS SAA]({{ '/aws-saa/' | relative_url }}) and [Security Specialty]({{ '/aws-security/' | relative_url }}) study notes.
